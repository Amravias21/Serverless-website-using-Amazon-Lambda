## Features

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Used for storing and managing static assets such as images, documents, and other files.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a front-end interface to AWS Lambda functions or other AWS services.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service used for running code in response to events or triggers without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Fully managed NoSQL database service for storing and retrieving any amount of data.
- **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**: Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have an AWS account and necessary permissions to create and configure the services mentioned above.
2. **AWS Configuration**: Set up the required AWS services, including S3 bucket, API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, and EC2 instances, as per the project requirements.
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure your local development environment with necessary AWS CLI tools or SDKs.
4. **Clone Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Amravias21/Serverless-website-using-Amazon-Lambda.git
   ```
5. **Configuration Files**: Update configuration files, if any, to reflect your AWS credentials and service configurations.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the project by following these steps:

1. **Accessing the Application**: Access the application through the configured API Gateway endpoint or EC2 instance, depending on the project architecture.
2. **Interacting with Services**: Perform various actions such as uploading files to S3, invoking Lambda functions via API Gateway, querying data in DynamoDB, or managing EC2 instances as required by the project functionality.
3. **Testing**: Test the application thoroughly to ensure all components and functionalities are working as expected.
4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Monitor the performance of AWS services using AWS CloudWatch and perform regular maintenance tasks to ensure the reliability and security of the application.
